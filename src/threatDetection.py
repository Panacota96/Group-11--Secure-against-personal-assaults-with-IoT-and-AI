"""
This module provides functionality to detect threat-related content in text using sentence embeddings.
Functions:
    is_threat(text: str, threshold: float = 0.6) -> bool:
        Determines if the input text is similar to any predefined threat-related phrases
        using cosine similarity of sentence embeddings. Returns True if a threat is detected,
        otherwise returns False.
Usage:
    - Loads a pre-trained SentenceTransformer model ('all-MiniLM-L6-v2').
    - Encodes a list of threat-related phrases.
    - For a given input text, computes its embedding and compares it to the threat phrase embeddings.
    - If the similarity with any threat phrase exceeds the specified threshold, the text is flagged as a threat.
Example:
    result = is_threat("I will attack you tonight")
    print(result)  # Output: True or False depending on similarity
